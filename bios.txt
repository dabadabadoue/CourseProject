Our research lies at the interface of multifunctional material development and electrochemical engineering. Electrochemical devices are ubiquitous to a broad range of energy conversion technologies and chemical processes. Their core components rely on complex materials that provide the required electrocatalytic activity and mass transport functionality. Our group has expertise in composite materials development, processing and characterization; and this expertise is used to improve and redefine electrochemical reactors with direct industrial applications. Our applied research approach also relies on fundamental understanding of the materials’ self-assembly and how their morphology and surface properties affects the mass transport and performance of electrochemical devices.

Research Interests: My group and I are interested in electronic, optoelectronic, magnetic, and catalytic materials synthesis and characterization with emphasis on understanding synthesis-structure-property-performance relations. We are motivated by fundamental questions as well as applications such as sustainable solar-to-electric energy conversion using solar cells. We use both vapor phase deposition and synthesis techniques (e.g., physical vapor deposition, plasma synthesis etc.) as well as colloidal synthesis to produce nanostructured materials, coatings, and thin films. Recent and current projects are on
(1) Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite inspired materials for solar cells, and light emission and detection
(2) Plasma-assisted synthesis, and
(3) Pyrite iron disulfide (FeS2) for solar cells.

I am interested in soft mesoscopic materials, including colloids, emulsions, polymers, surfactant solutions, non-Brownian suspensions, and gels. I have used and developed light scattering techniques, especially multiple light scattering (duffusing-wave spectroscopy) to study the structure and dynamics of colloids and other materials.  My current research covers a variety of topics, including self assembly, DNA-coated colloids, colloidal swimmers, lock-and-key colloids, random organization, and colloidal glasses.

He successfully pioneered the department’s transition from chemistry to biological sciences and engineering and introduced degree programs in biomedical engineering, biomedical sciences, and bioinformatics.  During this time, he also became head of the Polymer Research Institute (1996-2003). As associate provost of research and intellectual property (2003-2006), Levon focused primarily on the Institute’s patent portfolio. While in this position, he founded the Brooklyn Enterprise for Science and Technology (BEST).
He developed courses in biosensors, tissue engineering, sequence analysis, and protein structure/property relationship. His $5 million in research funding during a 10-year period led to novel discoveries in bacteria, virus, protein and DNA detection.
Levon earned his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Organic Chemistry from Helsinki University in 1976 and 1981, respectively, and a PhD in Agriculture from Tokyo University in 1986.
Levon holds over 15 patents and is the author of numerous published papers on early cancer detection, DNA hybridization, and other immunoassay-type investigations. He serves on the board of The Journal of Nanomedicine and the governing board of Nanomedicine and Drug Delivery Systems.
